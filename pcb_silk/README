I performed the following steps to get the inkscape design into PCB:

 1. Export to PS
 2. Convert to PCB with:
    pstoedit -usebbfrominput -flat 0.001 -f pcb:-mm [name].ps [name].pcb
 3. Fix the holes in letters with PolyCombine:

 4. Move everything to the silk layer
 5. Import the PCB file into the main layout
 6. Position things

Notes

The font is DejaVu Sans Mono and all text had to be converted to paths to allow
it to be subtracted from the rectangle. To ensure that the PolyCombine step
works you must reverse the winding direction of the polygon in InkScape after
subtracting the text.
